# Why?

The [Institute for System Programming of the Russian Academy of Sciences](http://www.ispras.ru/en/) has a fun ritual: every year they take a bunch of undergrads studying Computer Science in Moscow universities, make them write an operating system and boot them out of the university if they don't. This repository is my [song of joy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IS8J4ex6Uc) after going through this.

# Credits

The course and the source code are based heavily on the labs from [MIT 6.828](https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.828/2016/) adapted by ISPRAS and solved by yours truly. Special thanks goes out to [Alexey Khoroshilov](https://github.com/khoroshilov).
